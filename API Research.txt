API Research


		All other API services found were only paid services and required inquiries to receive information on pricing and 
	specific methods provided. The ideal solution would have been the Edmunds API. Unfortunately, this service was no longer
	supported and forced us to search for an alternative provider. I followed up on the leads provided by the USAA guest 
	lecturer: ChromeData, Blackbook, and CarQuery. After failed attempts at obtaining a student trial, they were ruled out
	 and I eventually found MarketCheck. Thanks to the generous offer of Dr. Lehr, it is now very likely that we will integrate
	 an API service to supplement our site features. 

MarketCheck - https://www.marketcheck.com/apis
	Paid for API service with 1 month trial version that charges per API calls.

		I registered under the trial version to be able to examine what services MarketCheck can provide for our project.
	Overall, MarketCheck does have relevant car services that can serve as additional features. These services, however,
	do not provide the basic car data we need that would serve as the main purpose of Supercharged. MarketCheck was the most 
	transparent company in terms of products and pricing. 

		An example of how a car information API would be used can be seen with examples from MarketCheck. An ideal UX would
	allow the customer to query information on his/her desired vehicle. After building significant interest in a vehicle,
	an Inventory search or Dealer query would be invoked to find the desired vehicle in the local area. If it is an used vehicle,
	the VIN Decoder may be used to provide information similar to a CARFAX report.
