Overkill Data Fields - datafield catagories that even casual gearheads would not understand, much less a layman;
					   datafield may be useless
	model_wheelbase_mm - wheel base size in millimeters
	model_lkm_mixed - (lamp control module) wattage
	model_sold_in_us - seems obvious that most/all models are unique objects. (2013 Red Mustang V6 and 2013 Blue Mustang V6 are still
						the same 2013 V6 model)
	model_engine_bore_mm - bore or piston field of motion is not generally factored for purchase
	model_engine_stroke_mm - stroke, similar to bore, is not commonly considered for casual users
	model_co2 - datafield could be good for this growing eco-mindful market but entire field is NULL
	model_make_display - seems irrelevant; field is same as model_make_id
	model_engine_torque_rpm - consider removing; can aid model_engine_torque_nm but too technical
