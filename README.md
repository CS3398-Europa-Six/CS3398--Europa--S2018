Next thing to work on:
Phillip - 

Trenton - I'll be working more with the frontend to modify that about us page, I'll also be changing up the header/footer,
	  adding a contact us page (moving the current info from the footer into that page), a sign in page, etc.

Fernando - Pending rates from commercial APIs, I will assist in API implementation

Nathan - 

Chase - Expand the existing db files. Then we need to get the website to display more information with queries. Also look into the alternative of an existing API. Can look into method to have user/pass into a users.db
