											11/7/18
Current Status : The website has more pages added to it, we finally got the database connected to the 
		 website and can start displaying all the data
		 
Next thing to work on:
Phillip - 

Trenton - I'll be working more with the frontend to modify that about us page, I'll also be changing up the header/footer,
	  adding a contact us page (moving the current info from the footer into that page), a sign in page, etc.

Fernando - Pending rates from commercial APIs, I will assist in API implementation

Nathan - Learn how to manipulate .db file to display on website and develope flask functions 

Chase - Expand the existing db files. Then we need to get the website to display more information with queries. Also look into the alternative of an existing API. Can look into method to have user/pass into a users.db
